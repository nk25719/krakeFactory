## Credits
I would like to express my gratitude to the developers and maintainers of several platforms. Firstly, GitHub, for its project management features, issues tracking, and project board, which have consistently proven useful during our usage. Additionally, I extend my thanks to KiCAD for providing the tools necessary for schematic capture and PCB design. I also appreciate the inventors and developers of the Arduino ecosystem, whose tools and hardware have had a profoundly positive impact on many individuals.

Furthermore, I am grateful for the Public Invention platform, which has facilitated communication and collaboration. Special recognition goes to my exceptional mentors and colleague Oyindamola Adeniran, Mr. Forrest Lee Ereckson and Mr. Robert Reed. Their guidance has been invaluable in navigating these projects, fostering skill development, and providing ongoing support. Their mentorship has empowered me to apply my knowledge to projects that benefit public invention.
